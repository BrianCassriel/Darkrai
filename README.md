#### CPSC 370 Final Project

---

This program was created in 2 days by a team of 5 students for the final project of CPSC 370 - Agile Development.
It procedurally generates a fireworks display in the console.
The fireworks are launched at random intervals and explode into particles that sparkle in a circular pattern. 
The user can also launch more fireworks by pressing the spacebar.

The purpose of the project was to practice Scrum and Test-Driven Development by creating some sort of console app.
We decided to create something fun and visually appealing.
